Last summer I applied and was selected to be a Student Ambassador for HKIS. I wanted to become a Student Ambassador as a way to show spirit for my School.

Recently I have been able to help with New Student Orientation by giving tours to the new parents. I had a lot of fun talking to the parents and communicating all the benefits of HKIS while showing them around the school campus. 

As a representative of the school, I also got to meet with our guest speaker from the US State Department. He was giving a presentation but he had questions about HKIS so I had the chance to speak with him along with my fellow Student Ambassadors. I was also on a student panel for the Parent Coffee where I answered questions about mental health on behalf the HKIS student body. As a Student Ambassador, I am also part of the Community Service Group and Charity Group and we plan to sell Christmas items at the annual Tree Lighting Festival this year to raise money for charity.

I am very proud and grateful to represent HKIS and to give back to my community.
