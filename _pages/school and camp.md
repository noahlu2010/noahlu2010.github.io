During the Summer of 2023,  I wanted to have a good understanding of boarding school life, so I decided I needed to experience it myself. What is the next best option? Summer school, of course. I went to the United World Colleges (UWC) in Chang Shu, Mainland China.

This was a 2-week experience similar to boarding school with loads of activities. For this camp, I decided to take the Environmental Science and Journalism class to pursue my interest in biology, and I also did many projects like my TED talk about how everything small has a purpose and story in which I used chickens as my example. My favorite part of the camp was being able to be with my roommates and having the "dorm experience" while also making new friends through hobbies like football. For my final project, I decided to write about 3 simple ways people like us can help save amphibians and I was very happy with how it turned out.

Apart from my UWC experience I also went to the Outward Bound camp in Hong Kong twice. Both times I was able to camp in tents with my friends and also experience the beauty of nature through hiking and kayaking. This was an amazing experience and was buckets of fun as after the first time I decided to go a second time the following year.
I really enjoyed both UWC summer school and Outward Bound due the the fact I was able to not only learn new skills and information but also because I could do so with friends.
