### United World Colleges (UWC) 

During the Summer of 2023,  I wanted to have a good understanding of boarding school life, so I decided I needed to experience it myself. I also wanted a cultural immersion experience in China, so what is the next best option? Summer school, of course. I went to the United World Colleges (UWC) in Chang Shu, Mainland China.

This was a 2-week boarding school experience with loads of activities. For this camp, I decided to take the Environmental Science and Journalism class to pursue my interest in biology. My favorite project was my TED talk where I used the simple and seemingly insignificant chicken to illustrate how everything small has a purpose. I also really enjoyed meeting my roommates and having the dorm experience while also making new friends through hobbies like soccer. For my final project, I decided to write about 3 simple ways people like us can help save amphibians.

Apart from my UWC experience I also went to the Outward Bound outdoor experience and overnight 5/6-day camps in Hong Kong twice. Both times I camped in tents with my friends and also experienced the beauty of nature through hiking and kayaking. This was an amazing experience and was buckets of fun as after the first time I chose to go a second time the following year.

I really enjoyed both UWC summer school and Outward Bound due to the fact I was able to not only learn new skills and information but also because I could do so with friends.
