During the Summer of 2023,  I wanted to have a good understanding of boarding school life, so I decided I needed to experience it myself. What is the next best option? Summer school, of course. I went to the United World Colleges (UWC) in Chang Shu, Mainland China.

In Summer 2023, I wanted to experience boarding school life. What is the best option? Summer school, of course. So I attended the United World College Chang Shu China. 
	This was a 2-week experience similar to boarding school with loads of activities. For this camp, I decided to take the Environmental Science and Journalism class to pursue my interest in biology. My favorite project was my TED talk where I used the simple and seemingly insignificant chicken to illustrate how everything small has a purpose. I also really enjoyed meeting my roommates and having the “dorm experience” while also making new friends through hobbies like soccer. For my final project, I decided to write about 3 simple ways people like us can help save amphibians and I was very happy with how it turned out.

Apart from my UWC experience I also went to the Outward Bound camp in Hong Kong twice. Both times I camped in tents with my friends and also experienced the beauty of nature through hiking and kayaking. This was an amazing experience and was buckets of fun as after the first time I chose to go a second time the following year.
I really enjoyed both UWC summer school and Outward Bound due to the fact I was able to not only learn new skills and information but also because I could do so with friends.
