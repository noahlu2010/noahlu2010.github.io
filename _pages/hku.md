Last summer I interned at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) Eye Centre, where I got to see how we can apply science to real life. At HKU Eye Center, the mission is to conduct clinical and translational research in ophthalmology while delivering eye care to those who need it most through the charity clinic.

During my time there, I had the privilege of shadowing eye doctors in the charity clinic program. This program offers free eye screenings and treatments to our community, particularly benefiting the elderly who often struggle to afford proper eye care. Many of these patients were diagnosed with glaucoma, a condition where increased intraocular pressure damages the optic nerve, gradually leading to blindness. This experience struck a personal chord as I thought of my own grandfather who faces the same challenge, and it filled me with gratitude to be able to contribute and make a difference.

Overall, my time at HKU was incredibly fulfilling, and I wish I could have extended my stay to continue helping numerous patients. This invaluable experience not only allowed me to deepen my understanding of biology but also ignited a desire to further pursue my learning in the field.
