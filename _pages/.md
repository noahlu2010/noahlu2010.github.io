title: "Student Ambassador"
---



Last summer I applied and was selected to be a Student Ambassador for HKIS. I wanted to become a Student Ambassador as a way to show spirit for my School.  

Recently I have been able to help with new student orientation by giving tours to the new parents. I have a lot of fun talking to the parents and communicating all the benefits of HKIS while showing them around the school campus. As a representative of the school, I also got to meet with our guest speaker from the US state department. He was giving a presentation but he had questions about HKIS so I had the chance to speak with him along with my fellow Student Ambassadors. I will also be on a student panel for the upcoming parent coffee where I will answer questions about mental health support at HKIS.

I am very proud and grateful to represent HKIS and to give back to my community.
