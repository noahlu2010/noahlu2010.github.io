During covid, I found a new passion and started playing chess in seventh grade. While it was just a hobby during covid between friends stuck at home, now it has evovled to an intense affection for chess post covid with even school being back last year. My friend and I wanted to be co-leaders for the Chess club to promote more opportunities for middle school students to play chess. We also wanted more avid and experienced chess players to be able to represent HKIS in chess competitions. We then presented our ideas for the Chess Club and the Chess Team to our Dean of Activities. Thus this year, I am the co-leader of the HKIS Middle School Chess CLub and the Middle School Chess Team.  As co-leaaders for the HKIS middle school chess team, together with the HKIS High School chess team, we won the Hong Kong Junior Rapid and Inter-School Chess Championship 2023 and the Malvern College Hong Kong Open 2023.

Chess is often associated with being smart. However, I do not think this is the case. While being smart will help you initially, it later comes down to skill based strategy, pattern recognition and the number of games played. My current favorite opening is the Modern Variation for the Scandinavian Defense for blacks because of its risky and unpredictable play style. This is where I give my opponent an advantage at the start but take it back a few moves later as it is very hard for my opponent to properly convert the advantage. This will lead to a position where I am more comfortable than my opponent and will lead me to have wins. After constantly playing chess for an entire year, I became confident enough in my ability and have started to teach some of the younger players how to better strategize in the game. It really made me think back to when my friend who inspired me during covid at the start of my chess journey.
