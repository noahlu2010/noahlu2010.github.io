I started playing chess seriously in 7th grade. My favorite aspect of the game is that there is no luck involved and it is completely skill-based. After playing in the Chess Club, my friend Eric and I played with other good chess players and wanted to represent HKIS in competitions. We then presented our idea for the Chess Team to our Dean of Activities and help signed off on our Chess Team.

Chess is often associated with being smart. However, that is not the case. While being smart will help you initially, it later comes down to pattern recognition and the number of games played as well as how familiar you are with an opening. This is why my current favorite opening is the Modern Variation for the Scandinavian Defense for blacks because of its risky and unpredictable play style. This is where you give your opponent an advantage at the start but take it back a few moves later as it is very hard for your opponent to properly convert the advantage. This will lead to a position where I am more comfortable than they are and will lead to many wins. After constantly playing chess for an entire year, I became confident enough in my ability and have started to teach some of the younger players by critiquing their games and mistakes. It really made me think back to when my friend was teaching me at the start of my chess journey.
